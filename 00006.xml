         <p>William J. Schull, PhD is an American scientist and geneticist famous for his research into the effects of ionizing radiation on the human body largely based on the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki after World War II. Dr. Schull began his scientific career in radiation research in 1949 when he joined the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC), established in Japan in 1946 by the United States National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council to study the effects of the bombings in accordance with a presidential directive from Harry S. Truman. From his first post as Head of the Department of Genetics at ABCC, Dr. Schull served many decades in the elite corps of scientists conducting research into the genetic impact of irradiation on human health. A professor emeritus of The Human Genetics Center, School of Public Health, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Texas, Dr. Schull served on most of the major governmental and non-governmental committees formed throughout the 20th century to quantify the effects of ionizing radiation. He helped form the genetics department at the University of Michigan where he served as a professor from 1956 to 1972. As his career progressed, Dr. Schull frequently served in executive positions, chairing many of the governmental committees he served on and becoming a director, 1986-1987 and 1990-1991, and in 1996-1997, vice chairman and chief of research of the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), established in 1975 as the follow-on organization to the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission. Dr. Schull was inducted into the United States National Academy of Sciences in 2001. In affirmation of his long and honorable service to the Japanese people, Dr. Schull received the Order of the Sacred Treasure, Third Class from the Emperor of Japan in 1992.</p>
         <p>William Jackson Schull was born on March 17, 1922 to Gertrude Edna (maiden name Davenport) (1900-1938) and Eugene Shull (1896-1975) in Louisiana, Missouri.  While Shull is the last name inscribed on his birth certificate, his name was changed to Schull while he was in elementary school.  Dr. Schull spent most of his boyhood in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and graduated from that city’s Lincoln High School in 1939. In 1946, Dr. Schull earned a Bachelor of Science in Zoology from Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1947, he earned a Master of Science in Zoology from the same university. He received a Doctor Of Philosophy in Genetics From Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio in 1949. Enlisting in December 1942, Dr. Schull served in the United States Army as a surgical technician with the 37th Infantry Division in the South Pacific until December 1945. In concert with his scientific work, Dr. Schull valued the preservation of the archival historic record and promoted the preservation of the history of the ABCC and RERF throughout his career. </p>
         <p>A detailed curriculum vitae is available for Dr. Schull in the control folder for his collection at the McGovern Historical Collection. </p>

         <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
         <p>The William J. Schull, PhD papers, MS 067, contains correspondence, interoffice memorandums, presentations, scientific works, journal reprints, monograph drafts, report drafts, travel diaries, travel receipts and itineraries, travel ephemera, other printed material, news clips, exhibit material, photographs, 35 mm slides, audios tapes, video tapes, film, maps and realia in eighty-six cubic feet of material documenting his the life and works.  Over 60 percent of the collection documents his life and work at the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC) and Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) in Japan.  Twenty five percent of the collection contains papers from his work for various governmental and non-governmental bodies about the effects of ionizing radiation. Another 8 cubic feet contains items from his personal life. Dr. Schull created travel diaries about the many international trips required for his work. The collection contains 62 typewritten travel diaries as well as many items of travel ephemera, mainly from Japan, collected by Dr. Schull. Dr. Schull wrote several books and the collection contains copies of the historical documents and photographs used in the creation of his books, notably "Song Among The Ruins," his memoir about his time at the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission.  The major theme of this collection is epidemiological and genetic scientific innovation used to quantify the threat posed to the human race by ionizing radiation; to establish the probability of health outcomes to alleviate the fear of survivors, especially about the health of unborn generations; and to provide governments with facts about the consequences of the use of atomic weapons for war and nuclear energy for industrial purposes.</p>
         <p>In addition to the records for ABCC and RERF (1945-2014), organizations with a large number of records in the collection include:  ICRP, International Commission On Radiological Protection (1980-1995); ICRHER, International Consortium For Research On The Effects of Radiation (1990-2002); UNSCEAR, United Nations, Scientific Committee On The Effects Of Atomic Radiation (1987); WHO, United Nations World Health Organization, Health Effects of Chernobyl Accident (1990s); United States Department of Energy, Advisory Council On Nuclear Facility Safety (1990); United States Environmental Protection Agency, Science Advisory Board, Radiation Advisory Committee (1984-1990); and BRER, United States National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council, Board On Radiation Effects Research (1990s).</p>
         <p>While the material is generally in good condition, some of the material suffered flood damage during tropical storm Allison in 2001.

         <p><!--Describe provenance or chain of ownership-->The McGovern Historical Center received these papers directly from William J. Schull during his lifetime. The papers were used by Dr. Schull during his work at various governmental and non-governmental bodies. In most instances, many people, including Dr. Schull, received copies of material as is common in institutional operations. Due to this, the papers are not always the original but are the copy received by Dr. Schull or forwarded to him by another. While Dr. Schull took many of the photos, others are copies of photos made by the organizations he worked for or the United States military. Film, video, and audio material was usually produced by media professionals that worked for the organizations involved. Copies were then provided to Dr. Schull.</p>

         <p>This collection was processed using a mix of item, folder and box level processing. Papers from the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission, later known as the Radiation Effects Research Foundation, received item and folder level processing as did the papers from Dr. Schull's personal life. Papers about radiation research at all other governmental and non-governmental agencies, genetics research, and expert witness activities received box level processing and are described at a box level. Flood damaged material was retained if any contents were discernible. A small amount of severely flood damaged material was discarded. </p>
         <p>Because the material was received from Dr. Schull in many smaller lots, this finding aid combines all of Dr. Schull's papers in one arrangement for the first time, since he began donating materials in the 1990s. Researchers using citations prior to 2014 may no longer have accurate box and folder numbers. Consult an archivist for more information.</p>
         <p>In this finding aid, the country name United States is frequently abbreviated as U. S. where the abbreviation was included in the title. Similarly, Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission is abbreviated as ABCC. The Radiation Effects Research Foundation is abbreviated RERF. The mnemonic ABCC/RERF is used to refer to both organizations. </p>

         <p>This collection contributes significantly to the historical record about the health effects of the World War II atomic bombings to survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. Documents in the collection provide detailed insight into the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission. Additionally, the collection adds records about genetics and epidemiological research into the health effects of ionizing radiation throughout the 20th century, the inner workings of the various governmental and non-governmental bodies tasked with understanding and controlling nuclear technologies, and the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear plant explosion in 1986. Dr. Schull was a senior leader in scientific research about the health effects of ionizing radiation and genetics for decades. His papers contribute valuable historical insights into these fields. </p>
         <p>As of October 2014, an International Consortium, consisting of Gakushuin University in Japan, the Texas Medical Center Library McGovern Historical Center in Texas, and the United States National Academy of Sciences archives in Washington, D.C., is working on a pilot project to digitize selected records about the history of the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission.

               <p><!--Brief description of component being described, such as series-->Scope and Content Note: This series contains items collected by Dr. Schull from the ABCC and RERF. Dr. Schull joined the ABCC in 1949 as the Head of the Department of Genetics. In common with other American scientists, he remained in residence in Japan for two years and then returned to an academic position in the United States but continued his research on ABCC projects.  Through a series of academic leaves of absence, Dr. Schull returned to full time work at ABCC/RERF in Japan in January-April 1954, July-September 1956, July 1959-September 1960, February 1964-January 1965, June-September 1968, 1978-1980, 1986-1987, 1990-1991, and 1996-1997. The papers in this series trend mainly towards these time periods. From 1959, Dr. Schull served ABCC/RERF at the Director level and above. Papers after this date reflect his senior executive positions and concern a wide range of ABCC/RERF subjects although papers from the early 1950s contain detailed information about genetics research at ABCC. Unfortunately, many of the early genetics research papers have the most flood damage. Recognized within ABCC for his interest in historic preservation, Dr. Schull received many items from others. </p>
               <p>Established in Japan in 1946 by a presidential directive from President Harry Truman, the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC) was established to undertake long term studies of the health effects of the atomic bombings on survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan. American members of the ABCC faced many scientific challenges along with the physical challenges of living in a foreign, war destroyed country and the human challenges of working with a population scarred irreparably by the atomic bombs' horrific power. Documents in this collection show that initial investigations focused on hematological effects. But ABCC scientists soon realized that many other research protocols were required especially in genetics and epidemiology. They invented more than a few research protocols and contributed strongly to the 20th century genetics and epidemiology disciplines. Throughout its history, the ABCC faced many challenges centered around its value to the scientific world, funding, and the appropriateness of its mission. In 1975, the Japanese and United States governments renegotiated their agreement so that the Japanese government took the lead in funding and governance although the United States continued to provide funding. The new arrangment caused the organization to be reconstituted as the Radiation Research Foundation (RERF). Today, the contributions of the scientists who worked in the organization are widely respected and highly valued by both countries as their research has proven to be essential to navigating the Atomic Age. Documents in the collection show that Dr. Schull frequently credited the courage and generosity of the Japanese people for their participation in studies that were all too frequently physically painful, time consuming, and intrusive to personal privacy. </p>
               <p>This series is organized in subseries that reflect the daily operations of the ABCC and RERF. Material about the history of the ABCC and RERF is included in this series.</p>

Administration of the ABCC/RERF included such functions as budgeting and capital funds, legal and contractual issues, staffing, salary administration, record keeping for employees, research statistics maintenance, information technology including the organization of medical data bases to support research, employee recognition, public relations, printing and publishing, and employee and community social activities. The records concern operations in Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Kure. The records are organized by creation date earliest first. Dr. Schull kept his Department of Genetics papers in three ring binders. The papers have been removed from the binders due to flood damage. The original order and notebook tabs have been preserved. Many of these papers have substantial flood damage.

The material is arranged by meeting date. Folders variously contain correspondence between parties responsible for arranging the meeting (many times Dr. Schull was consulted on draft agendas), travel grant applications, itineraries, travel arrangements, travel receipts, meeting agendas, attendee lists, presentations by Dr. Schull and others, invitations to social events conducted as part of the main event. Some files in this subseries are RESTRICTED due to the presence of exposed survivors’ names or the presence of Japanese professional curriculae vitae. Consult an archivist for access.

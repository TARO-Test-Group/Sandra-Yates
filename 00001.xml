         <p> Traditionally, Grand Rounds consist of presenting the medical problems and treatment of a particular patient to an audience consisting of doctors, residents, and medical students. The Grand Rounds in this collection are like a lecture series with a range of medical-related topics from the history of medicine to current treatments and knowledge about specific diseases.  </p>
         <p> Also included in this collection are tapes of the Clinicopathologic Conference (CPC) series. CPC is the well established abbreviation for Clinicopathological Conference.  However, it also can stand for the process of clinicopathological correlation.  The CPC conference is a time-honored interdepartmental and interdisciplinary approach in which a patient’s clinical findings and course are presented, followed by a discussion usually focused  on the differential diagnosis by a knowledgeable clinician, followed by the presentation of the pathological findings by a pathologist, culminating in a general discussion.  The goal is to provide increased understanding of diseases by correlation of clinical and pathological findings.     </p>
         <p>These videos are in good condition. The collection covers the years 1990-2002. This is a box level inventory. Only a date range is given for the videos. There is no other descriptive information. The videos are in VHS format. There are 6.5 cubic feet (13 boxes).</p>

               <p><!--Brief description of component being described, such as series-->Scope and Content Note: This series is about Clinicopathologic Conference (CPC). CPC is the well established abbreviation for Clinicopathological Conference.  However, it also can stand for the process of clinicopathological correlation.  The CPC conference is a time-honored interdepartmental and interdisciplinary approach in which a patient’s clinical findings and course are presented, followed by a discussion usually focused  on the differential diagnosis by a knowledgeable clinician, followed by the presentation of the pathological findings by a pathologist, culminating in a general discussion.  The goal is to provide increased understanding of diseases by correlation of clinical and pathological findings. There are no transcripts of these recordings. Each box is arranged by the video dates. The time frame for each box is the only description given.
